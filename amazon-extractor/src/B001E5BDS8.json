Classic Zippo Chrome Lighter. Works like a charm. Just wanted to get one just for the heck of it. Classic sleek and small enough to carry around anywhere. Yea it scratches up, but what do you expect from something made out of chrome? I think it adds character to your lighter actually. Sure you can purchase those disposable lighters that can hold more lighter fluid than this Zippo, but it ain't as good looking as a Zippo. If you want something that looks classy and potentially last forever get this! Its the most reliable lighter you can get in the market.

MADE IN U.S.A.\" which is always nice to see. :-)<br><br>What's not to like? I've had and lost a few Zippos over the years... but I've never had one break or fail. Just have to remember to top them off regularly with lighter fuel, which is quick and easy to do. The fuel is the standard-issue stuff like Ronsonol Lighter Fuel you can get at hardware stores and gas stations, and it's pretty cheap if you buy a larger container. The 12oz Zippo brand fuel available on Amazon is also a pretty decent deal--that's quite a few refills and will last a while unless you like using your Zippo as a lantern to read by or something. Which probably wouldn't hurt the lighter any... might get hot, though.<br><br>If you're not prone to losing things like I am, a lighter like this one might save you a bit of money over its life vs buying replaceable ones or matches all the time.<br><br>Be aware that these lighters are not pressurized like a butane lighter. So the flame does not \"jet\" out the tip. It's more like a portable candle. So it blows out easily, and if you hold it at crazy angles it might burn your hand. I mostly use it for starting campfires, lanterns and candles, and as a backup portable light source.

It's already got that \"used\" look to it (which I enjoy) so there is no harm in throwing it around in your pocket with change and whatnot. It lights on the first flick of the wheel almost every time and the fluid lasts a long time. DO NOT OVER FILL! If fluid drips out of either the top of the unit or spills out the filling end, you will have to wait for it to evaporate, otherwise when you flick your Zippo on the entire thing will burst into flames and you will most likely drop it. This has not happened to me but it is definitely possible. Remember this isn't a disposable lighter and it requires maintenance. You need to refill it, and replace the flints or wicks every so often, but it is a very nice lighter. Great for your money, and it's made in the USA like they always have been.

If one were to buy a Zippo at a fine Tobacconist, the Proprietor of said establishment may fill it for you the first time, but after that, you're on your own. These lighters ARE NOT airtight. The fuel evaporates after a while, in as little as a week. If you're looking for a lighter that you can toss in a drawer, or glove box of a car and use once a month without having to fill it, don't get a Zippo. If you're looking for a lighter that you can leave in your bug-out bag or something, don't get a Zippo. If you're looking for a lighter that won't run out of fuel while you're camping for a month, don't get a Zippo. If you have an affinity for camping with fancy-looking lighters, get a Colibri or something. Heck, some Colibris even have built-in cigar cutters.

This one also didn't disappoint. It reminds me of my dad when I was a child. He had a plain old silver/gray one that he'd gotten while in the Navy during the Korean war and used for about 60 years . I was hoping mine would be the same dull sheen as his but alas it's got to get beaten up for years to get that same look I suppose. I've usually used ones with Seahawks emblems on them so I tried to protect them from losing that polished aluminum sheen and color. I got this one so I could stop babying my lighters or fearing loss/theft of an expensive lighter.<br>I use Zippos for everything from lighting cigarettes to campfires and my charcoal heater as well as burning stray threads on clothing. Whatever I need to light it works for its intended purpose without fail, no matter the weather conditions as well.<br>Being a long time user I'm already aware that you've got to fill them pretty regularly but, just like throw away butane lighters, they do warn you a dozen or so lights before they run out by taking multiple attempts to get a flame. I've got a special place on a top shelf in the laundry room for my fluid, flints and wicks but in all the years I've been using them I've never needed to change a wick. A 4oz bottle of fluid costs about as much as a 3 pack of Bics and lasts about a year.<br>Something different between Zippos and disposables is for whatever reason the Zippos don't seem to fall out of my pocket or some other way disposable lighters always manage to do to disappear for long periods of time.<br>If you want a lighter that is cost efficient over the long haul, will take a  beating for decades without failing (if it does fail Zippo will fix it for free forever) , is dependable, is still made in the U.S. and can become a legacy piece handed down (my older brother got my dads when he died) that has a distinctive sound when opened or in your pocket, you can't beat a Zippo. If you're looking for one to take out only a few times a year, or less,  and have it light with no filling or other work this is not what you want. For that a Bic will last for years and be trouble free, unlike ultra cheaply priced disposables.","date":"July 10, 2015","author":{"name":"<span class=\"a-color-secondary\">By</span><span class=\"a-letter-space\"></span>Captain Cuttle","link":null}},{"title":"Great lighter for a great price","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"Lighter arrived very fast.

And since the butane (BIC style) lighters are most readily available, they are the most often used.<br><br>THE CLASSIC ZIPPO, THOUGH, IS ACTUALLY MUCH BETTER FOR AN OUTDOORSMAN THAN ANY DISPOSABLE BUTANE LIGHTER (DBL).<br><br>=&gt; Zippos produce a much more robust flame than DBLs, which give only a very thin jet of flame.<br>=&gt; Zippos do not blow out in the wind so easily as DBLs. I'd stop short of saying that Zippos are \"completely\" windproof but they are highly wind-resistant. DBLs aren't even a little wind resistant.<br>=&gt; Unlike DBLs, a Zippo will give you a sustained flame without any danger of blistering your thumb. You can even light it, set it aside, and keep it burning like a candle if you like.<br>=&gt; Unlike DBLs, a Zippo won't accidentally bleed off its fuel while fraternizing with the other stuff in your pocket or pack. (They do dry out, though. I top mine off with a couple Cubic CMs of fluid once every couple of weeks.)<br>=&gt; Though I have not personally tried it, I am told that if you get caught short of fuel a Zippo will work with alternative fuels, such as kerosene. (If you intend to experiment with this, exercise caution!)<br>=&gt; Last but not least is the Zippo lifetime warranty. If a Zippo fails to work, just go on their website for instructions on returning it. They'll fix it for you free and even pay the return postage for you.<br><br>Tip: The lighter fluid (naptha) is a skin irritant. Rather than jamming it right into your pocket when freshly refilled, it is a good idea to let it sit out for an hour so that any excess fuel can evaporate.<br><br>Update, January 2013: I have found an easy fix for the \"fuel evaporation problem\" I mentioned. Cut a piece of bike inner tube as a sleeve to encase these lighters once fueled. I have found that instead refueling the lighters every couple of weeks I can wait a couple of months before having to top them off.

Nothing can really happen to a lighter with such a simple, years-proven design. You can easily disassemble it yourself for servicing purposes, if needed. Whatever happens, you just need some high-octane fuel to keep it working (of course, during a peacetime special zippo liquid is recommended for better performance and minimum smell :).<br>I personally like high polish chrome with no engraving or picture on it, as it looks most neutral and stylish to me.<br><br>As for the gas smell by the way, is not strong when the lighter is closed.<br>The lighter is absolutely suitable for all the situations when you would take your bic lighter previously.<br>It is not too big or heavy.<br><br>I like the fact that you don't need to keep any button pressed to keep fire going. This might be useful when you use the lighter as matches - you can pass it to your friend, use to start a fireplace, warm your hands or even maybe warm some food.<br><br>I have noticed that inner part goes outside for 2-3 centimeters when you open/close the lighter for a few times, however it does not go further. But I've fixed this by putting a small aluminum foil strip inside the lighter.<br><br>You have to get some practice so you won't put an excessive amount of fuel when \"recharging\" the lighter. I recharge mine once per 1-3 weeks.<br>By the way, this lighter comes with no fuel, so make sure you've purchased some zippo liquid if you want to use your lighter right away. Or consider buying a zippo all-in-one kit which includes liquid. But as far as I know, there are no kits with high polish chrome lighters.<br><br>The lighter is wind-proof and it does not afraid of some amounts of water or sand.

I almost bought one of Zippo's BLU butane series lighters (because I smoke cigars too), but after some thought, I could'nt imagine someone like John Wayne lighting his smokes with a Zippo BLU butane, so that kind of sealed the deal for me... not to mention that the cheapest Zippo BLU is 3x the cost of this little beaut.  After purchasing this lighter, strangely enough, all my friends who smoke want to get their own Zippo and they ask to borrow this when they light their smokes instead of using their little Bic lighters.

I'd even tried to keep it in a ziplock bag to slow the fluid's evaporation, but that got awkward.  – I like that it’ll lit during our bitterly cold 40 degree winter days when my Bic lighter won’t -- It's easy to refill the lighter, BUT we must be careful to not overfill it because the wick can be too wet to light, then gives a ball of fire when it does.  Of course, it's downright embarrassing when I overfill it, I get fluid on my hand, I light it and my kids then think I'm some kind of superhero with a flaming hand.  OKAY, that didn't all happen, but I get eager for a smoke, have to wait to refill the lighter (again) then wait even longer for my hand to dry off.  I DON'T consider this dangerous if anyone has a lick of common sense.  BUT remember the reason these faded out of common use was because of how easy they are to light by toddlers and kids.  I personally inspected a burned-out home because a 3-yr-old got hold of one, lit it, dropped it when it burned his hand and the flame stayed lit. -- -- All considered, I don't use it, but keep it handy as a backup along with a can of fluid.","date":"January 10, 2014","author":{"name":"michael j poole","link":"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEVKC2V2P6HS2NGRDAWEGY7T2DIA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"}},{"title":"Great quality, as expected of Zippo","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-4 review-rating","body":"Loved it so cheap and simple.

I found the construction to be decent, as I expected. The finish, alignment, and small parts are all well done. No fault to the lighter, I don't think you can avoid the little hinge being the weak point. I have not had any problems with the hinge yet, but if you dropped the lighter or it got opened and bent in your pocket or something, the hinge wouldn't stand a chance. Not too likely, but accidents happen. If you are careful with it, I imagine it will last a lifetime. Flint wheel action, flame, wick entry, and general construction seem like they will function suitably for the next few decades. Compared to a standard disposable lighter, the parts on a Zippo are built like a tank, and you don't have that much additional weight. A real benefit is that you won't be throwing out a bunch of plastic lighters anymore. Just one thing you can't do with a Zippo that you can with a disposable. I sometimes use lighters to burn bugs, mostly ticks. The Zippo will not shoot a flame like a disposable lighter will. The flame just gently burns straight up from the wick, meaning if you turn the lighter on its side, the flame goes up thru the flame guard. So I still keep one of those on hand for just such occasions. Anything else, if you need a flame, the Zippo will do the job. (I don't know if Zippo's new BLU line of butane lights might throw a flame, but could be worth looking into if you need this.)","date":"August 24, 2012","author":{"name":"<span class=\"a-color-secondary\">By</span><span class=\"a-letter-space\"></span><a data-hook=\"review-author\" class=\"a-size-base a-link-normal author\" href=\"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFMVSVDSLSO2HNFTPQBMPVAX4SCQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8\">grigoli</a>","link":null}},{"title":"Zippo lighter","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"Reminds me of my Grandpas lighter.

The street chrome lighter has a \"scratched\" appearance to it (which is what I was looking for).  It gives it a used, \"weathered\" appearance, but still looks nice.  I am a pack a day smoker and have always used Bic lighters, but decided to give a Zippo a try.  Aside from the fact that I have to refill the lighter about once a week, I have thoroughly enjoyed it!  I love the classic Zippo click sound when you open and close it.  One thing I discovered that is a plus, is that the wick is actually a couple of inches long, so when you need \"new\" wick, all you have to do is take a pair of needle nose pliers and pull the wick up to the desired height, and then trim it.  I have been using this everyday for almost a month, and have not have to pull more wick through or had to replace the flint yet.  One safety note: for anyone who has never used a Zippo before - when you light it - it stays lit until you close the lid or the flame gets blown out.  If you light it and drop it on the floor by accident like I did, there is a good chance it will stay lit.

This one is minimal and it looks nice.<br>2. Once I filled it with fluid, it lit right away. No flint or wick issues.<br>3. Hinge has a good click to it.<br>4. Solid Zippo build quality.<br>5. Surprisingly inexpensive for a Zippo.<br><br>Cons<br>1. None so far.<br><br>Unless this thing unexpectedly dies (I'll update my review if it does), then I can't think of a reason why this wasn't a good purchase. It works well, it's minimal, and with the fluid and flints I bought, it should last me many, many years. Goodbye forever plastic lighters.","date":"May 7, 2015","author":{"name":"Amazon Customer","link":"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHGHALKMMXWI7JW3YTNFOFZXEWPQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"}},{"title":"great lighter","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"good lighter","date":"September 23, 2015","author":{"name":"<span class=\"a-color-secondary\">By</span><span class=\"a-letter-space\"></span><a data-hook=\"review-author\" class=\"a-size-base a-link-normal author\" href=\"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEOCZ4BC2ZOMZCGVDD4N4GLHFMPA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8\">Thu Nguyen</a>","link":null}},{"title":"It's exactly what I wanted.","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"I have fancy expensive Zippo's but I rather not lose them or break them.

It most certainly does look like the picture, but it also has a bit of a gloss to it when you first get it.<br><br>When I received my lighter, it came with a piece of paper stating that the finish was designed with wear in mind, and the clearcoat was intended to gradually wear off. True to its word, after a year of having it, the clearcoat has scratched and worn off a bit in some places as intended, but the silver plating is still 100%.

I just can’t stand throwing them away a product that is really still good to use if you could refill it.  I figure that one $10 purchase to get a zippo is worth it.  I have really enjoyed this lighter from the moment it arrived.<br>It really lights in the wind so we use it to start fires in our outside fireplace very often.  We have replaced the wick a few times and also the flints but they are really easy to manage.  Make sure you just buy some flints, wicks and fluid so you have them when needed.  We are not smokers but we use the lighter often to light candles and fires.  It’s a good purchase.<br>How I rate --<br>5 Stars: Works exactly as advertised, is a good value at the price point purchased, would buy again or recommend to a friend.<br>4 Stars: Works mostly as advertised, fit/finish are what you'd expect when purchasing this type of product, might have a minor flaw.<br>3 Stars: Generally works but it may not be a good value at the price point or might like to see changes / improvements.<br>2 Stars: Barely works but can be made useful if you try.<br>1 Star: Useless, does not perform its intended function whatsoever and is generally a waste of money, sending it back.<br>Overall: I am giving this a five star rating based on my criteria above.  The lighter is worth every penny in my opinion. It works well and should last a lifetime.  If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will try to respond. If you found my review helpful or lacking also let me know I like to continuously improve. I hope this helps you with your decision making process.","date":"January 31, 2017","author":{"name":"<span class=\"a-color-secondary\">By</span><span class=\"a-letter-space\"></span><a data-hook=\"review-author\" class=\"a-size-base a-link-normal author\" href=\"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGGRB6XWXH2AUGIFMOE7QAVFF7FA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8\">Dean S.</a>","link":null}},{"title":"Five Stars","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"Zippo.

I felt the thicker body and lack of paint would help it hold up to use of non standard fluids while the high polish chrome finish would let it double as a reflective device. The body's inner dimensions are slightly longer than that of the insert. this creates an air gap that does not exist in my standard body zippo. This caused my armor zippo to drain of fluid in less than three days versus my other one. However I came across a remedy for fluid drainage altogether: I created a seal out of bicycle inner tube that has allowed this lighter to hold fluid(denatured alcohol this time) for over 2 weeks now. This is an idea that people looking for the Zippo as a prepping item can look to. I used one strip each at the base and lid(each meeting flush with the seam) and a third meeting over them.","date":"June 15, 2014","author":{"name":"Jake Hancher","link":"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF5GNCM4CFRK5HILFBQ5QGP4QMNA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"}},{"title":"Looks nice.","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"Satisfactory shopping Thank you very much","date":"May 12, 2016","author":{"name":"<span class=\"a-color-secondary\">By</span><span class=\"a-letter-space\"></span><a data-hook=\"review-author\" class=\"a-size-base a-link-normal author\" href=\"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEGQSMPDWUBOEDWAFJ7I2PGTP5NQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8\">acs</a>","link":null}},{"title":"play between insert and body","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"good /// very goog quallity","date":"March 5, 2015","author":{"name":"acs","link":"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEGQSMPDWUBOEDWAFJ7I2PGTP5NQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"}},{"title":"Five Stars","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"I have been needing a new Zippo since I lost my last one.

I was critical of someone else on another Zippo model because he was complaining that the fluid evaporated out after 3 days.  I would expect that in a device like this.  A zippo to me, is an emergency lighter.  Just keep zippo fluid around.  It is easier in my opinion to tell you if you have a full bottle of zippo fluid, than a full canister of butane.  Plus, I would think it would be easier to obtain.  I am not sure if zippos can use other fuels like naptha in an emergency, but I will be checking into it.<br><br>I ramble, but I wanted to say, I got mine over a week ago, filled it, and it still has fluid, so maybe mine seals better.<br><br>This device is very solidly built to tight clearances.

I wanted a Zippo that could be carried around in my pocket with loose change, a money clip, and other items which could mar the surface of a lighter. The random scratch pattern on the surface is actually quite attractive. Any minor \"new\" scratches will be completely invisible on this unit. The rest of the Zippos in my collection are \"collectables,\" and I want to keep them pristine, since the ones with logos and art work ARE in fact, works of art. Mechanically, all Zippos are pretty much identical. They light easily, and they are of such simple design, that they function flawlessly. I've been collecting flint &amp; fluid types of lighters since I was a kid in the 1950's, and I have yet to have owned one that I couldn't get to light. They are quite simply, too simple not to work! If you have a flint loaded, and flick the thumbwheel and it produces a spark, and you have a half inch of lighter fluid soaked wick, it WILL light. It doesn't have any choice! It would even light with non-approved fuels, like naphtha based lantern fluid, or even gasoline (I learned this when I was a dumb kid). I have a warning though: DON'T USE UNAPPROVED FUEL!!!!! Gasoline has dyes and other additives which will quickly foul your lighter, and it produces a horrible smell. Lantern fuel (such as Coleman) is similar to lighter fluid (naphtha is the key ingredient in gasoline, lantern fluid, and lighter fluid), except it burns hotter, and will evaporate quicker. DON'T USE IT. To do so would be dangerous. Use approved fuel only, such as Zippo, or Ronsonol (which is now made by Zippo). Why do I say that you MUST use an approved fuel? Because cigarette lighter fuel contains retardants which produce a more controlled burn rate, and also retards evaporation so that you don't have to refill the lighter as often. There is also the safety factor here to consider, in having a less volatile fuel.<br><br>OK, so where do you get flints and lighter fluid? Before the highly reliable, long-lasting, disposable butane lighters were invented, lighter fuel was available virtually everywhere: Mom&amp;Pop stores, hardware stores, grocery stores, drug stores. In fact, it was hard to find a store where it WASN'T available. DON'T buy flints and fluid online. It is way too expensive, and they are not that hard to find in stores. I found the Zippo 12 oz. cans of fluid at my local grocery store (a well known national chain, which I don't want to plug) and it was priced at $3.50. The best place however, to buy flints and fluid is at the nation's largest retailer (the one founded by the late Sam Walton). It is usually located at one of the check stands. They sell Ronson flints for 40 cents (5 pack), and Ronsonol fuel (8 oz. can) for $1.65 (I'm plugging Ronson/Ronsonol because it's made by Zippo). Also, you can obviously find these products at specialty stores which sell pipe tobacco, cigars, etc. These are usually located in shopping malls and strip malls. You might pay a bit more at the specialty stores, but still, it would be cheaper than having to pay shipping and handling charges for online purchases.<br><br>User problems:<br><br>I still can't get over the number of people who think that this type of lighter should come filled with fuel. They aren't allowed to ship them that way. These lighters are not sealed units and are subject to evaporation. A tightly sealed shipping carton would fill up with volatile fumes. Such a box might even technically be considered a BOMB!<br><br>Can't get it to light?<br><br>(1) Sometimes after filling the lighter, raw fuel gets onto the flint, or the wick is oversaturated (too wet). Leave the lighter upright with the top open, and evaporation will take care of this problem. In a few minutes, try again.<br><br>(2) Bad Technique? If you are new to this type of lighter, you may be having trouble with the thumbwheel. Practice your technique. Flints are cheap! Remember when you were a kid, and somebody taught you how to snap your fingers, to make a very loud pop? It is the same sort of technique for operating the thumbwheel. A wimpy turn of the wheel will produce little if any spark. A hard, quick snapping of the wheel will produce a massive spark, and increase your chance of success.<br><br>Some final thoughts &amp; suggestions:<br><br>These flint and naphtha based fuel lighters are relics of the past, and are best thought of as nostalgia, or collectable art pieces. If you are going camping or hunting, ALWAYS carry spare matches, or a butane lighter with you as a back-up. As several people have mentioned, these lighters lose fuel fairly rapidly due to evaporation. Always fill them on the day of your outing, and bring spare fluid and flints with you (Zippo makes a cute little key-chain canister which holds one lighter full of fuel, and an extra flint, available from Amazon). Another good reason that you MUST keep your lighter well fueled, is that the wick will burn up when it goes dry, and you will have to replace it.","date":"February 11, 2011","author":{"name":"<span class=\"a-color-secondary\">By</span><span class=\"a-letter-space\"></span><a data-hook=\"review-author\" class=\"a-size-base a-link-normal author\" href=\"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFS3C54F7ZMXIVQD76YNKE65C7YQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8\">Jake</a>","link":null}},{"title":"Well, its a zippo","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-2 review-rating","body":"Zippos may seem cool, but they're a really stupid product.

I have bought countless disposable lighters over the years and saw a Zippo here for only $9 and some change, so I decided to go for it.<br><br>These are nicely constructed of steel with a sturdy hinge. The best part is they are made in America. The lighter is very different from the Bic at the corner store you may be used to. It uses a compartment filled with cotton batting that you soak with lighter fluid. At first I thought something was wrong. The area where the lighter fluid goes is not really air tight nor does it have a secure bottom. In fact there is only a piece of felt that keeps excess fluid from leaking out of the bottom of the lighter. But I digress. The lighter lights very easily as the flint produces a robust spark. However, when you turn the lighter on its side to light a candle the flame does not protrude from the \"chimney.\" It makes lighting candles rather difficult, to the point where I immediately went back to my old disposable.<br><br>This is a great lighter for a smoker.

If it is not genuine then it is a very good fake. The insert is genuine but they could have bought the cheapest zippos available to get the inserts. The case is well built with the year, zippo stamp, the word \"sterling\", an armor symbol, and \"MADE IN U.S.A.\". However, the lid and base of the case don't fit correctly. When the lighter is laid on a flat surface, one side has a gap about the width of a fingernail. That doesnt sound like much but when the lighter is closed and the gap is closed, you can see that the top is skewed to one side. That is not a huge deal but none of my other zippos have this issue. I am almost positive that the case is sterling silver because it is not magnetic, the weight seems correct, and it will tarnish in a new York minute.<br><br>I ordered my lighter from D3als4you (seller on Amazon). The lighter is not the brushed finish you may expect. It looked like it was ever so slightly brushed but the brush marks dissapeared in a day. No joke. It was like someone brushed it by hand with a rag. It really is a great lighter but if it is not a genuine zippo it is only worth about $40. That's the cost of this type of lighter plus silver weight. The only way to tell for sure if it is genuine is to send to zippo for repair or compare against a known genuine zippo from the same year 2014. I may just do that and then update this post.

It's a beautiful piece and that \"flick\" sound is just so satisfying.<br><br>That said, as soon as you get it in your hands, the disappointment starts. The lid doesn't align with the body very well. I knew before buying that the fuel evaporates, but I was surprised that is only takes 5-7 days for it to evaporate from full to empty *without use*. I thought it would take at least two weeks. The evaporation rate might be a problem with my expectations, but I can't help but think that if the lid fit more snugly, it would evaporate more slowly.<br><br>When you actually try to light the lighter, it's even more disappointing. I don't think there has been a time I've successfully lit it on my first try. Typically it takes 3-5 tries to get it lit. That's really crippling to this being a good fashion accessory. When you see the guy with his leather coat lighting a cigarette in a noir film, he doesn't spend thirty seconds fiddling with his lighter. Failing to light your lighter does *not* make you look badass. 79 cent BIC lighters light on the first try, why can't a Zippo?<br><br>You know those movies where the guy lights a Zippo and then tosses it into a gasoline covered car or building or whatever he wants to burn?

Amazing product!<br><br>Chances are, you already know about this nifty little lighter!<br><br>They've been around for quite a while and everyone who has them, seems to have had them for a while. Some that I've seen are much older than a lot of us! The thing with these are, yes they light amazingly in almost any weather (they even pass the fan test! youtube \"Zippo fan test\") but more importantly, they hold stories. The things some of these lighters have been through far outweigh anything you and I have ever seen. They are built for life. Which is why they have a Lifetime Warranty.<br><br>Their warranty is phenomenal. I've had nothing but good experiences with them. They will fix ANY Zippo lighter, even if it was your fault.<br><br>Again, these lighters are great, if you are willing to upkeep it. It does use Zippo (save $ by buying Ronsonol) Naphtha fluid which is NOT INCLUDED. It is illegal to ship these types of lighters with fluid in it. It will eventually need more flint, and extra wick. Both fairly cheap and easily available with Amazon Prime. Unfortunately, it holds the fluid in a NON AIRTIGHT chamber of  a cotton like material called \"Rayon\". In short, cotton comes from the plant and is harvested relatively quick, while rayon comes from the tree (bark) and takes YEARS to harvest.  Although cotton is much stronger than rayon, rayon is far more absorbent than cotton and wicks exceptionally better. Unfortunately since the Zippo is not airtight, it \"leaks\" fuel. If not in use, the fuel will eventually evaporate, leaving you with a fireless lighter.*<br><br>*PRO TIP: You can remedy the fuel leak issue, by taking a tire tube (or any tight, round, stretchy rubber material), stretching it out and inserting the Zippo around the crease of where the lighter opens. You can just roll the rubber down when you need to light, and you will refuel less frequently!<br><br>^also, they have a butane insert made for Zippo lighters called \"thunderbird butane insert\" which will basically make your Zippo into a refillable BIC style lighter. They are extremely useful and well worth the $<br><br>PRO TIP: You can keep extra flints (I'd recommend 2-3) right under the cotton \"flap\" to the fluid filling chamber. You can simply refill fluid regularly because the extra flints doesn't affect the lighters performance in any way. This helps tremendously in a survival situation, because with a spark, you can have a fire.<br><br>-PRO TIP- WHEN YOU FIRST RECEIVE YOUR ZIPPO-: unscrew the screw and take out the flint spring. Ensure the extra bit of wick \"zigzags\" around the Rayon balls.<br>ZigZagging:<br>-Take the Rayon balls out of the middle of the filling chamber (The one piece of rayon wedged to the side doesn't matter)<br>-Extend the extra wick fully, then insert a little wick, then rayon, then cross over with wick, then rayon, repeat.<br>-Kind of like an \"S\" shape. This will help the wick transfer fuel better thus helping the lighter light more efficiently.<br><br>If you think this review was helpful in any way, there is a button to let me know!

Feels good in the hand. All ZIPPOs are mechanically identical, only the case finish differs.<br><br>ZIPPO offers 4 'Chrome' finishes--High Polished Chrome(a mirror finish), this Brushed Chrome, a sandblasted flat-matte 'Satin Chrome' and a 'Street Chrome\" which is the High Polished Chrome after being lightly pre-scratched as if in a tumbler.<br><br>For new ZIPPO buyers: All lighters in the USA are by law shipped 'dry' (without fuel), so you'll want to buy ZIPPO brand or Ronsonol brand lighter fluid from any drugstore or WalMart near you. About $5 for 12 oz, and that will last you a LONG time. Filling takes about 10 seconds. Instructions come with your ZIPPO and there are tons of useful how-to's on youTube, the ZIPPO website and on the various online Lighter Forums.<br><br>Lighter fluid (naptha, and not the same as \"charcoal lighter fluid\") gradually evaporates over a couple of weeks or so out of any lighter (even if not used) and will need refilling.<br>New ZIPPO owners are sometimes surprised to learn that they can't just drop this in a drawer for 6 months like any disposable Bic lighter. (Bic's are truly airtight). So a Zippo is not what you want to leave inside your long term emergency evacuation bag --the Bics are a better choice for any standby kit. You CAN slow down evaporation about 50% by storing the ZIPPO in a ziplock freezer bag.<br><br>This is a great, useful fun retro item and a beautiful piece of Americana to own. Also check out the Street Chrome, Satin Chrome, Black Crackle, Camo, Olive Green Matte and 1941 Replica models.<br><br>At $11-12 delivered this is less than half what you would pay at a smoke shop or retail outlet.

First of all, I do smoke a pipe and, sometimes cigars. This Zippo works well with either. I buy stuff to actually use, so I don't care if it gets scratches and such. I carried a Zippo back in the 60's while in the Air Force and never wore one out. I did lose several though. My favorite ( black Playboy one) was carried and used daily for about 4 yrs before I lost it. I have never had to replace a wick in one. Average flint change is about 2 months with most of them (with heavy use). I fill mine about every 3-4 days to keep from burning the wicks out, but have gone around 7 days before it actually ran out.<br>  I do not notice any odor or unpleasant taste with quality fuels. In fact a wooden match gives me a worse taste than any lighter on average. Also, after refilling, I wipe mine off with a paper towel or old cloth and give it a burn or two before putting in my pocket.<br><br>Pros: 1. Work best with Ronsonol, Zippo, or Naptha fluid. 2. Will work well with Coleman White Gas (like for Coleman Stoves), but I do notice a little odor with it. Will work with unleaded gas in a pinch, but really has a gas odor. 3. Works in wind better than anything except maybe a butane jet lighter. 4. Works at any altitude that I've been. 5. Lasts forever and has warranty. 6. Is high quality and made in U.S.A. 7. Inexpensive for good basic model like this one. 8. Can replace wicks and flints, and both are cheap to replace. 9. Will pay for itself in the place of about 4 disposable lighters.<br>Cons: 1. Needs to be refilled with liquid fuel, NOT BUTANE. 2. Fluid drys/evaporates in average 6 or so days. 3. Need to replace flints every few months. 4. May need to replace wick if it burns out. 5. Some fuels have more odor than others. 6. Fuel can irritate your skin if you don't wipe it down after refilling.","date":"June 24, 2016","author":{"name":"<span class=\"a-color-secondary\">By</span><span class=\"a-letter-space\"></span><a data-hook=\"review-author\" class=\"a-size-base a-link-normal author\" href=\"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFT5HPLQ7UFVBW7VKWA5V7R2NEWA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8\">LifeCoachLandryYouTube</a>","link":null}},{"title":"Not a good one.","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"This is an awesome little lighter.

I saw this armor lighter and wanted it for my collection. Of course I wanted super shiny chrome for the brilliant shine and good grip when doing tricks. I can say this lighter is way different than the regular zippos. It is much heavier and the distinct clink sound when opening the cover sounds different. When I opened the cover and pushed the sides together it doesn't bend and give like the regular zippos. The walls are thicker than the regular zippos and it feels heavier. I didn't do much tricks on this one because it feels very heavy and in the past I broke a couple zippo covers. Since the cover on this one is heavier I was thinking it might fly off easier with the heavy weight. This armor series is very nice and durable and has a nice bulletproof name to stand behind it. You will be happy with this strong lighter. I bought a regular chrome zippo also. Side by side comparison you can see the difference in thickness when opening the lid to look at the wall thickness. Two very different clink sounds when opening. I use the regular one for my tricks. It's also cheaper than the armor. Just by looking at it closed they look identical until you hold it and feel the weight difference and open it up. Chrome shows fingerprints and smears a lot from the oils on your hand and will show scratches easily. Unlike the brushed steel that is slippery when gripping and doesn't have that brilliant shine that the chrome has. You could probably use the chrome zippo to signal for help out at sea or stranded hiking its so shiny.

They certainly always looked and sounded cool in the movies! Since the barrier to ownership was a measly 8 bucks, I decided to remedy that. The Zippo is definitely all about the sensory experience these days: they aren't practical, since the fuel will evaporate over time and you'll have to refill it all the time even if you don't use it. They basically only work to light anything when you can hold it upright, or very close to upright. That said, they have such a lovely sound - which I don't need to describe to anybody - and the coolness of snapping it closed one-handed is a real thing. The tall flame is also very nice and much hotter than a Bic or similar flame, plus you don't need to put pressure on anything to keep it burning.<br><br>I can see how, for a smoker, these could be more convenient, since the motions of using one are so effortless once you get used to it.

I've had it for 15 years, and I can say it's one of the better lighters I've used. It's super-simple only one moving part, no electronics, no electric igniters, no pressurized butane, and it's just about bulletproof. You can stomp it, run it over, drop it, dunk it in water, or leave it outside for weeks. It's wind-resistant and will burn just about any flammable liquid you can put in it, but I don't recommend anything other than Zippo or Ronson fuel, which is mostly naphthaline and some other hydrocarbons.<br><br>I really do love the Zippos. They've been around forever and haven't changed a bit aside from some simple updates. It's made from formed sheet brass, I'd say about 28 gauge-it's pretty thin, that's gone through an extruder. The fuel reservoir, chimney, wick, and flint wheel are housed in the insert that slides into the body. It's made from sheet steel, bent and formed. The fuel reservoir is stuffed with cotton to hold the fuel, and the wick threads up through it. It's caped off by a dense piece of cotton held in place by a spring-loaded brass screw that houses the flint holder. To fill, you lift the cotton and squirt in the fuel until the cotton is saturated. Put the insert in the lighter body, and you're good to go! The lid is spring-loaded and snaps shut to extinguish the flame and keep out dust and dirt. It's not water proof, so it's not a water-tight seal, but it still resist water and would light when wet.<br><br>To light it, flip the top and spark the wheel and that's it! Super simple. The wick is cotton with metal inserts to keep it standing up straight. It will last forever, and the only thing I had to replace was the flints, which also last a long time.<br><br>As far as durability, this is one of the most durable lighters I've ever owned. It will last forever if you take care of it. The only things that would wear out is the wick and possibly the spring mechanism that holds the lid closed. It's wind-resistant. I've got it to keep lit in pretty windy conditions. The flame is bigger than most all lighters as well, as much as a butane lighter turned all the way up or more. The fuel lasts a long time if you don't keep it lit for long periods, otherwise it won't last nearly as long as a butane lighter. It's easy to fill, and it's important not to over fill it as it will leak out of the wick and all over the place. When you light it, poof! You'll have a lighter on fire. It uses the standard \"Zippo\" type fuels. I recommend only Zippo brand or Ronson. You could use gasoline, paint thinner, Coleman fuel, jet fuel, or diesel in a pinch, but I don't recommend it.

I wish they would include a lighter fluid as well, but sadly they do not. Most probably because zippos are not very good in holding in the fluid, so a zippo sitting around on a shelf would just evaporate into the air. Compaired to other lighters out in the market now, zippos aren't really the best choice if you're using it as an emergency/survival item because they'll dry out on you after a week. This is mostly a collectors thing now or novelty item nowadays, Although, if you really wanted tom you can buy a different piece for your zippo's cotton fluid storage compartment that is enclosed it won't run dry on you like a typical zippo. A classic zippo like this would require a lot of lighter fluid and maintenance because you have to add it every week or so.

I pictured it as an \"every day carry\" piece - if the need for fire arose, I would be ready!<br><br>Unfortunately, I was let down in the \"reliability\" department by Zippo - not by a malfunction in parts, but in design.  The lighter is not a sealed unit - the fuel is free to evaporate away as the lighter sits unused.  After 2 weeks or so a full dose of fuel will waft away, leaving the lighter useless.  If you're an \"every day\" user, you may not notice; however, if you use it only occasionally you'll find yourself having to add fuel before each strike.  Not the ideal tool for emergency or even occasional use.<br><br>That said, it functions beautifully when topped off.  One strike and you've got a strong flame no matter what the wind or precipitation, and it'll stay lit long after your fingers tell you it's time to put it down!  Everything fits together the way it should, and there is no \"wiggle\" in the hinge on my example. The thicker case of the \"Armor\" version clicks shut with a satisfying \"clunk\".

That might be the reason that a fill only lasts about 3 days.

I was hoping for one without defects to have as a nice engraved keepsake but crap like this ruins it.","date":"April 30, 2017","author":{"name":"Mark Humphrey Jr.","link":"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFIRF3AZKWNFOTUEB57D4H7Y2RAA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"}},{"title":"Five Stars","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"looks nice ans simple yet sleek. i like the weight as well as its functionality. it lasts longer than any other lighter that i have used. great product indeed.","date":"January 13, 2016","author":{"name":"<span class=\"a-color-secondary\">By</span><span class=\"a-letter-space\"></span><a data-hook=\"review-author\" class=\"a-size-base a-link-normal author\" href=\"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFUQI6X22V36C7IBODPZYQJ4PMEQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8\">maicheng</a>","link":null}},{"title":"Quality Control Has Gotten Lazy","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"very very good","date":"November 21, 2017","author":{"name":"maicheng","link":"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFUQI6X22V36C7IBODPZYQJ4PMEQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"}},{"title":"awesome product.","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"This Zippo lighter has the same great quality as Zippo lighters that I have purchased in the past.

Before this I sometimes carried matches and at other times carried the disposable bics, and still at other times had no fire starting device at all.<br><br>Now I carry this tiny lighter with me every day. I don't smoke, however I have the idea that a \"man\" should carry a lighter in order to offer a woman a light, if you can find anyone these days that the government still lets smoke.  It's called having manners. Yes I could just have that bic brand, but I just don't want to be one of those losers carrying a 99 cent bic. I want something with class. I could have also chosen an electric ignition type of lighter too, but this is my only one, and I like old school technology.<br><br>Ok about the lighter - It's got a very strong put together feel to it. It's very solid. The cap flicks easily and comes back to where it should. The construction is very well done. And it's made here in the USA! (Hooray!)<br><br>One thing that I have learned is to keep it topped off; it's a small unit so the fuel goes quickly. I don't smoke but I do play with it a few times a day - hey I'm a guy and I like toys - so be sure to fill it at least once every day or so. I also think that it is not sealed like some more modern lighters so some of the fluid evaporates. Actually from time to time I do smoke cigars and this is a great lighter for that too.<br><br>I do often have problems getting it to light on the first flick. This is both from the flint and in part to the wick. I have gone to two dealers so far, and both have pulled up the wick, and I do have extra flint. So it's a bit like an old Jaguar (or an old other type of classic car) it does require a bit of maintenance. But it's fun and so classic.<br><br>The unit is very lightweight and thin. It fits easily into the front corner pocket in my jeans and does not make any unsightly bumps in my suit jackets. It has a classic iconic look to it, when I do get to light a cigar or cigarette it brings a great smile to the one getting lit.

I purchased this lighter because I have always been fascinated by the idea of a device capable of producing flame. I could easily have bought a cheap Bic or other disposable brand, but I prefer the simple elegance of the Zippo's timeless design. The surface is smooth, and very shiny. Unlike some cheap \"chrome\" products, this is genuinely shiny metal, not just a thin coat of silver paint over dull pewter. The spring-loaded latch keeping the case closed is well-balanced; a flick of the wrist opens it, but it stays closed on its own. As for the lighter insert, I was impressed with the simplicity of the design. The flint sparks easily, lighting the wick- at least, in theory. I was disappointed to discover that the lighter ships empty- that is, there is no fuel inside. I had to run out to the store and buy some lighter fluid to make it work. Other than that, the filling procedure was simple: the insert can easily be removed to add more fluid. My only complaint is that the wick is tightly woven into the cotton in the insert, so when the wick burns down you have to disassemble the entire thing to advance the wick (absent a pair of needle-nose pliers.) Overall, though, I am very satisfied with this product. I carry it around so I can hold it up at rock concerts, and so far it has not failed to light as long as I keep it fueled and maintained.","date":"October 19, 2010","author":{"name":"<span class=\"a-color-secondary\">By</span><span class=\"a-letter-space\"></span><a data-hook=\"review-author\" class=\"a-size-base a-link-normal author\" href=\"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFPOJVZHFI3FZSOJOLTF4YXFZY4A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8\">changhui</a>","link":null}},{"title":"The quintessential lighter","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"great lighter","date":"September 21, 2016","author":{"name":"changhui","link":"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFPOJVZHFI3FZSOJOLTF4YXFZY4A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"}},{"title":"A True Classic","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"I thought it might be a bit cheap since it was priced at $7.

If you want one of those, go get a Bic. This is a Zippo! Sure, you have to refill it some, (since it comes without fluid, and dries out after a few weeks) and you can mess up your wick easier than you can mess up a regular lighter, but that's kind of the point. You see, this is the kind of lighter that you're supposed to buy and actually care for, which is part of its charm. If you mess up the wick, grab some tweezers and some scissors and pull the wick up a little bit (its surprisingly long) and cut the wick to the desired length. If you use up your flint, go buy a new one (I think they're like 59 cents for 3 at Wal-Mart) and put it in yourself. And if you do manage to mess it up beyond easy repair, you can just mail it to Zippo, since they offer a lifetime warranty on this product. Past that, I don't think I know a lighter that's nearly as much fun to light. The flint wheel and flint are quality components, and the lighter stays lit without you having to hold some stupid plastic button to keep it that way (did I mention that there isn't a single plastic component in the whole lighter?). I don't know how well I've described the kind of warmth that seems to grow in you for your Zippo as time goes by (For example my friend still has one from 2003, so he's had a single lighter for 4 years), but I can only hope that I've piqued your interest enough to go invest the 10 or 15 bucks to have one.

The finish is not gauranteed and mine had been used so long that most of the chrome was worn off around the edges and some in the middle of the case. I found this wear to be sort of a record  and history of all the places it had been with me. I was heart broken at it's loss.<br>It was definitely the most valued $5 I have ever spent.

So frustrating, I can't tell you how many times I've been left striking the damn wheel until my thumb hurts. I really don't understand the high rating for this one. At least a Bic will always light if there is fluid, and it's not broken ; can't say that for Zippos.<br><br>The only time Zippos seem to work is right when they're new or right after it was previously lit. It's really strange I've had the thing so soaked in fluid it was running out the wick and it still won't light. If you bring a flame to the wick it takes right off and will usually re-light well for a while. I don't get it but what good is an unpredictable lighter? These CANNOT be trusted for something like camping, trust me been there done that. They sometimes just refuse to light especially if it's cold or it hasn't been used in a day or so.<br><br>I guess they're designed for cigarettes where you are constantly lighting and extinguishing, they do work well enough that way.

But... a few weeks later, it didn't work on an overnight camping trip. All the lighter fluid had evaporated from the storage compartment, despite the fact the lighter had been sealed in a ziplock container and not subjected to extremes of temperature. A few weeks earlier I'd filled it to capacity; now it was useless.  So I can't really give this product high marks for the use I intended it. If all you need is a household lighter and you have plenty of fluid on hand for refills, then it's OK.  Otherwise, it is a lighter that doesn't provide light and that's pretty useless.  Fortunately for my camping trip I had some REI storm matches that worked flawlessly.

This lighter was just a bid headache.","date":"July 28, 2013","author":{"name":"<span class=\"a-color-secondary\">By</span><span class=\"a-letter-space\"></span><a data-hook=\"review-author\" class=\"a-size-base a-link-normal author\" href=\"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFZNGOSFZMNT2S2KUYBERVWR6QIA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8\">moe</a>","link":null}},{"title":"waste of money , i just got it &amp; it doesn't work 😒doesn't light up , looks nice but total waste of time &amp; money","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-1 review-rating","body":"not good.","date":"April 26, 2016","author":{"name":"moe","link":"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFZNGOSFZMNT2S2KUYBERVWR6QIA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"}},{"title":"DOES NOT COME WITH THE LIGHTER FLUID.","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-1 review-rating","body":"Even though they is fuel, fresh wick and a new wheel, it sometimes doesn't want to light.
