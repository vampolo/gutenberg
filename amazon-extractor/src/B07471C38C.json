[{"title":"The phone has arrived!","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-4 review-rating","body":"EDIT: The Pixel 2 has arrived, and I am happy to report that the case and all buttons fit perfectly. It does add a good grip and feel to the phone, without being large. The Pixel 2 is a small phone, so it's not as narrow as can be with the case, but it's close. Without the case, the pixel is 70mm wide. With the case, it is 73mm. This is a hair thinner than the more plasticized case from the competitor on my 5X, which still remains much more 'tough' feeling. That case makes the Nexus 5X jump from 72 to 77mm, 2.5mm on each side. So if thin with protection is your thing, this Rugged Armor should do the job nicely.<br>Side-note: The Pixel wasn't as slippery as I thought it would be. They did a great job texturing the back of the phone.<br><br>A background: I have several Spigen cases and screen covers on my phones and when it came time to get one for the new Pixel 2, the options were slim. Spigen did have this 'Rugged Armor' case ready for shipping now (before the phones fully arrive), and since the Slim Armor and Tough Armor models were not going to be ready for another couple weeks after release I did not want to take the chance of dropping my sure-to-be-slippery Pixel within a week of getting it. The Google cases are light cases, the cloth ones are nice looking but don't provide a lot of drop resistance, which I discovered on my old Nexus 6P. Thus, since this was one of the only options available for a reasonable sub-20$ price from a reputable manufacturer at the time, I went with this Rugged Armor case.<br>The Rugged Armor case is a light, flexible side and back bumper. It adds minimal thickness to the phone. It adds a roughly 1.5mm front edge to keep the display off the table and a thicker 2.0mm backing to cushion blows from the back. It's not rubbery at all, it's a little slick, but nothing like the metal edges of a phone. It has cutouts for the fingerprint scanner, camera, sensors for the camera, a mic port on the top and bottom, and the USB-C port. The power/volume buttons are covered partially... I'll upload a picture to demonstrate.<br>The biggest issues I have with this case is how flimsy the material feels and how it's called the 'Rugged Armor' model. I used to have a Slim Armor set from Spigen on my old Nexus 5. The base rubbery bumper (which then was held in place by a more solid reinforcing wrap) felt a little sturdier than this case... this one just seems like it will twist too easily. Compared to the slim armor or other single-piece cases I've used in this price range, it feels fairly flimsy and I'm not convinced that it adds any less bulk then some of the more sturdy material models. If I compare this rugged armor one-piece to a one-piece competing brand I use for my Nexus 5X, it's very obvious which one is more sturdy, and without necessarily adding thickness in key measurements.<br>Like mentioned, an additional concern I have is the naming. I'm not sure how long Spigen's been using the 'Rugged Armor' name but it sure sounds to me like something that would be STRONGER than the 'Tough Armor' and especially the 'Slim Armor' models. This one is definitely a step behind those two, and looking at prices now, the Tough Armor (not available yet) is only a couple bucks more than this one. I will be buying a Tough Armor one down the road and I plan to compare the two cases measurement-wise to see if you are really gaining 'slimness' by going with the Rugged Armor case. While this naming isn't really an issue, if this doesn't save a healthy amount of bulk over the Slim or Tough cases it's hard to justify why you'd want this instead.<br>At the end of the day it seems that it will definitely suffice in its mission: give me more friction to hold my new Pixel in place while a different case arrives, while costing a third of what Google wants for its swanky cloth cases. Plus, the carbon fiber pattern on the back is a nice touch.<br><br>tl;dr: I wanted to give this 4/5 because it doesn't appear to be a bad case and it's not proven anything yet (I don't even have a phone to put into it), but its floppiness disappoints me when sitting next to a competitor that housed my Nexus 5X.","date":"October 10, 2017","author":{"name":"<span class=\"a-color-secondary\">By</span><span class=\"a-letter-space\"></span>Emily Osburn","link":null}},{"title":"The case feels sturdy enough, like it would get the job done","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"The case has worked really really well, for the short time I have had it.

Normally I would purchase a case a few months after owning a phone or when cases go on sale, but decided to make an exception this time around.<br><br>Build quality of the case is very good. Phones feels more sturdier with the case on without adding much bulk/weight.<br><br>I like the textured back. Makes for a better grip on the phone.<br><br>Case is very easy to slip on-and-off like a glove.

Your finger gravitates to it very naturally and way better than the flat deign without the case, where i tend to miss press maybe 1/15 times having to re-position my hand and/or fingers<br><br>Carbon fiber is okay. Great visual appeal. Not sure why they added on both the top and bottom of the phone. Would be cool if it were only around the camera, but guess they want to keep the phone design more symmetrical?<br><br>I like how the power and volume buttons are flush with the case, so not additional grim or dust can enter. Wish there was a nub or dot on one of the buttons to get a better indicator when picking up the phone and blind pressing.

I'm actually keeping this case and returning the Neo Hybrid (nice case, but slippery, squirts out of your hands like a bar of soap).  Now, this probably isn't the most heavy-duty protective case on the market, but I've been extremely pleased with it, especially for the price!  For a slim case I'd say it's VERY protective.  The cut-outs are perfectly aligned, active-edge works perfectly, buttons are easy to press, material of the case is firm enough to feel like phone is protected, but not stiff/brittle, the slim profile is great, and the raised lip around the screen equals YAY!

It provides a very decent level of protection while not adding the kind of bulk that turns it into a brick. There is a tiny raised ridge that runs around the front of the phone protecting the screen adequately. The back is a good blend of protection, grip and style. The \"carbon fibre\" design looks good.Definitely better than it sounds. The finger print reader is quite heavily recessed, giving you a decent idea of the protection it offers. If you have enormous fingers I suppose that might be a problem. I had a very similar case on my last phone and it protected it from a couple of minor drops and a couple of bangs against wall corners while being carried. I expect this will provide equally good protection based on my first few days with it. I don't use a screen protector as I've not found one necessary with glass improvements and this kind of raised-edge protection. If you're looking for a tank-like case this probably isn't for you.

I have this case on my Nexus 6P, though, and I had good experiences with it there so I decided to take the chance with this one. It seems like a pretty solid case that should do well to protect the phone. All the ports are there, and there is ample space for them, so no blockage issues. I have no issues with activating Active Edge (the squeeze feature) with the case on, and if anything it's probably a little easier to do since there's a little more grip and a material to squeeze. The fingerprint port continues to feel like an improvement over the bare phone since it guides you to the sensor and makes it less vague where the sensor is, though it does make it a little bit harder to use the fingerprint sensor swipe (for pulling down the notifications/quick access). There is a raised lip for the front so if you put the phone face down, the glass isn't going to touch the surface, which is really nice.<br><br>There are a few things to be aware of with the case though. While the ports have ample space, they are apparently aligned slightly off-center from what they're allowing access for. The bottom microphone, for example, is right about on the top of the port (the microphone hole isn't blocked at all though), rather than centered, and the top microphone has a similar but less pronounced offset. Likewise, the port for the fingerprint sensor is slightly offset low and left, so top right edge of the sensor is about equal with the port while there's a bit of excess space beyond the sensor to the bottom left. None of these affect performance, so it's more of a small detail that just irritates a person who likes things to be centered, level, etc. The buttons for the case work fine, though they're not fully enclosed; there are small gaps above and below (or to the sides, depending on how you're looking at it). I tell myself they're for helping water drain or something, but what it seems most likely is that they'll allow some dust and small particles in there. I also wish the separation of the volume up and volume down buttons was a little more defined. I hate volume rockers and much prefer individual buttons, so I like this case because it essentially turns a rocker into buttons, but they're separated and individually defined a little better on my 6P case compared to this one. The carbon fibre inserts look nice, but they're also recessed/the majority of the case bulges out some. This is actually kind of good because it means if you put the phone down on its back, the camera isn't touching the surface (assuming a hard, flat surface like a desk) at all, so you're less likely to accidentally scratch the glass. However, this also seems like the case adds a little more bulk than is maybe necessary (not bad for me since I like my phones to feel substantial). And finally, the case is pretty snug, which isn't necessarily bad but it does mean the phone is a little bit tough to get into the case, and I worry that I might accidentally scratch the phone trying to get it in or out.<br><br>I did order a tempered glass screen protector but it's not here yet, so I don't know how well the case will work with that, but if you don't have a screen protector on, it's a really solid case. There are enough nitpicks for me to give it a 4 instead of 5 star rating, but nothing so bad that I wouldn't highly recommend the case.","date":"October 25, 2017","author":{"name":"<span class=\"a-color-secondary\">By</span><span class=\"a-letter-space\"></span><a data-hook=\"review-author\" class=\"a-size-base a-link-normal author\" href=\"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGJ22ON7UKXMK54NZ5SOZCSGKIFA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8\">Sean</a>","link":null}},{"title":"Good look and fit, poor protection for drops.","stars":"a-icon a-icon-star a-star-5 review-rating","body":"I normally hate cases, but after buying Nexus phones for years this Pixel 2 is by far the most I've spent on a phone in a while, so I wanted to keep it safe.

I guess this is why the power plug (cigar lighter type) has an on/off button on it. It does not wire into reverse, but one has to turn it on and off each time it is used.<br>The camera has distance lines which show up on the screen, and which can be useful.<br>The camera bracket does not allow for lateral movement, just vertical up and down movement<br>The camera bracket had to be modified a little as the camera bracket would not tighten down . The screen is exactly the same although it did tighten a little better. This tends to restrict where the display can be placed as it cannot be directed towards the driver at an angle.<br>Plenty of cable supplied but it is a 4 pin DIN-type socket and not the usual 5 pin. For me this was a nuisance as I have a better camera, with IR, but it has a 5 pin connector.<br>For the money, I believe the item is worth it for a fairly trouble-free instal without having to break into the car wiring or reversing switch.","date":"October 26, 2017","author":{"name":"<span class=\"a-color-secondary\">By</span><span class=\"a-letter-space\"></span><a data-hook=\"review-author\" class=\"a-size-base a-link-normal author\" href=\"/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AELHQ6E6CNZ2SYYRC3CH4DCHACQA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_pdp?ie=UTF8\">jbt</a>","link":null}}]
